# Birdr API

### Setup

This API is built using Ruby on Rails (5.1). To get setup you will first need to ensure you have the latest version of Ruby installed (2.4.1+), as well as the [bundler gem](http://bundler.io/):

```bash
brew install ruby
gem install bundler
```

Once installed you can install the API dependencies by running `bundle install`:

```bash
cd birdr-api
bundle install
```

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
